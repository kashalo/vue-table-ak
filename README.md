## Prerequisite

-  This package is vue Components so you must have VUE in order to use it.
-  Your data must contain any kind of unique key in order the Table action (Edit , InlineEdit , Delete ) to work properly. If you didn't specifiy the unique key the components by default will consider that your feed contain property called **id** and look for that unique key if the component coudn't find it, the bulk actions will be disabled even if you enabled it in the configuration. Of course you can change the default behavior to use any other field as long as it's uniqe for example if your unique key is **sku** you can define that in the configuration for more details please check the config section. [please check the config section](#config-object)


## Usage

This components accept two Props : 

- **feed** (Required) type `Array` : this is the main data source for the table to render the HTML content if the feed is not valid or empty an error page will be displayed
- **Config** (Optional) type `Object`: The config Probs allow you to configure the table features based on your requreiments and it's completely optional if not specified the default configuration will be used.

 

**exmaple without the config option:**

```html
 <vue-table-ak feed="data" ></vue-table-ak>
``` 

**exmaple with the config option:**

```html
 <vue-table-ak feed="data"  :config="tableConfig"></vue-table-ak>
```
